# Personal Website Project

## Description
This repository contains the code for my personal website project, created as part of a school project. The website includes at least 3 web pages and a job application form-page.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `index.html`: Home page of the website.
- `job_application.html`: Job application form-page where visitors can apply for a job.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (for form validation and interactivity)
- Ionicon (for icons)
- Git (for version control)

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the home page.
3. Navigate to other pages (about, portfolio, job application) using the navigation links.
